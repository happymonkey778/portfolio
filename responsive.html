                <h1>Context</h1>
                <p>
                    We all know that there are variety of websites out there. The internet
                    is quite wild, you know. In fact, currently,
                    there are around 1.14 billion websites in the World. 
                    17% of these websites are active, and 83% are inactive. Moreover,
                    some of these websties can do wild AI powered 3 dimensional stuff.
                    Sadly, this isn't the case for all the websites out there. Thus, for this
                    project, I picked one of those poorly designed webssites and offered an
                    alternative. Here is the story.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="context">
                <h1>Why this particular Website</h1>
                <p>I chose this website because it has a simple enough user interface 
                    with some major usability, learnability, memorability, 
                    and accessibility problems. I believe that the root of these 
                    problems was poor planning of where each relevant section needed 
                    to be. Even though the material the website includes is of good 
                    quality, the design choices made for the website made it quite 
                    unintuitive to navigate through.
                </p>

            <div class="thisOnly">
                <h1>Spotting the Points of Improvements</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="context2">
                
                <h4>Learnability</h4>
                <p>
                    There are two navigation bars on the top. 
                    One of them includes mostly social media icons, 
                    but it also includes a home button and an email button. 
                    These aren’t intuitively related, and it becomes even more 
                    confusing with the second navigation bar that includes news, 
                    about, media, and links. The second navigation bar is divided 
                    into two halves and there is no particular reason to make such 
                    a division either. These factors are quite unintuitive and make 
                    it difficult to navigate through the website.
                </p>
                <h4>Memorability</h4>
                <p>
                    Moving down from the top menu, the next sections don’t have titles.
                    This makes it hard for a revisiting user to remember where to 
                    navigate when looking for a particular thing on the website such 
                    as his podcast.
                </p>
                <h4>Usability</h4>
                <p>
                    The placement of the menus isn’t intuitive. On top of this, 
                    there are repeating elements(e.g. buttons) dispersed around 
                    the website that lead to the same place. Even though if placed 
                    wisely they could assist the user, they are causing more confusion, 
                    harming the usability of the website.
                </p>
                <h4>Accessibility </h4>
                <p>
                    The web accessibility evaluation tool, Wave, surfaces some problems 
                    such as missing alternative text, low contrast, unordered list 
                    elements, redundant links, and missing headings at multiple levels. 
                    An example would be the “1956-2022” button. This looks like a 
                    clickable button that would take the visitor to a related page but 
                    it just loads the page again. Additionally, there are some 
                    overlapping elements. There is an Instagram and a Twitter post that 
                    is embedded in the second big section, but the Instagram post and 
                    an equal size div are placed on top of the Twitter post. 
                    This prevents the user to see some major parts of the content, 
                    making the website quite inaccessible.
                </p>

                <h1>Conclusion & Feedback</h1>
                <p>This project has thought me a lot. I found it quite useful to start with
                    an already existing website and spotting what went wrong with it. A lot of
                    times, it is quite hard to see what can go wrong without the mistakes actually
                    being out there. This project made me think critically at every stage about every
                    decision I made on the process.
