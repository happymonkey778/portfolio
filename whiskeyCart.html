                <p>
                    Well, in a world with 133 distilleries licenced to produce
                    Scoth whiskey, there is no doubt some people would love to be
                    particular about what they consume. When the menu is so large,
                    it becomes quite hard to track the regions and the age of each
                    whiskey. At the point that you do, you want to match your
                    wallet's energy, and this is exactly when the sorting feature
                    becomes handy.

                    The end product offers filtering features both based on the regions of Scotland,
                    and age ranges. These filters work in peace with each other, meaning you can filter
                    Highland whiskies that are aged for 10 years. On top of this, user can also sort These
                    filtered results from high to low, or low to high pricing. Finally, the whiskies can be
                    added to or removed from a cart that calculates the total sum of the items.
                    This product can be utilized by whiskey collectors, liquor store owners, and anyone
                    who is simply interested in playing around!

                <h3>Usability Principles</h3>
                <p>It offers a pretty simple user friendly interface.
                    The titles are utilized to emphasize the functionality of the
                    buttons and checkboxes. The page has a white backgorund and uses
                    simple black text on it which ensures contrast.

                <p>The filtering can be found on the top and the menu of whiskey
                    items are listed right underneath. At the bottom of the page

                    the total number at the end of it.

                <h3>How Data is Passed Down Through Components</h3>
                <p>After current filtering are applied to the data,
                    rest of the items are displayed through the WhiskeyItem component.
                    The component also takes in the updateCart function, which is
                    triggered by the button on each Whiskey item to add them to the cart.
                    Similar Logic takes place for the Cartitem.
                    It goes through the list of whiskeys and check for the ones whose count
                    is greater than 0 to view their name price and count on the cart.

                <p>It is pretty easy to create such useful tools at one's convenience.
                    I really enjoyed using the REACT framework for this project as it is
                    extremely competent, and handles dependencies quite well.
